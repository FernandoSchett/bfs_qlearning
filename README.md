## Developed by 💻:

## About 🤔:

This project addresses the challenge of using Q-learning and DFS algorithms to distribute orange fox species in territories, ensuring that foxes of the same species cannot coexist in the same territory. The problem is modeled using graphs, where foxes represent vertices and edges connect foxes of the same species. The minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring corresponds to the number of territories needed.

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- **Graph Representation:** Visual representations of colored graphs, showcasing the distribution of fox species in different territories.
- **Coloring Algorithms:** python DFS (Depth-First Search) and Q-Learning implementations are used to color the graphs.
-**Hyperparameter Analysis:** Analysis of hyperparameters, providing graphical images by iteratively varying hyperparameters.
-**Algorithm Complexities:** Analys includes time and space complexities for each implemented algorithm, aiding in understanding their efficiency.
